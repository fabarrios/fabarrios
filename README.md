### F.A. Barrios. Ph.D.  

I was born in Mexico City. Studied physics as undergraduate and worked in theoretical physics until I took a postdoctoral Fogarty Fellowship at the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch at NIMH, to work in MR functional brain mapping under the direction of Dr. D. Weinberger. Where I participated in the very early efforts to develop fMRI. At present time I am a Full professor at the Neurobiology Institute, UNAM, head of the Functional Brain Mapping Lab studying the neural correlates of cognitive processes in particular those related to the perception of empathy and the neural correlates of consciousness.  I am the Department of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurobiology Chair. I have more than 105 peer review publications with more than 1050 cites and 20 h index and more than 120 presentation in international scientific meetings.  I am a full member of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping where I am member of the Latinamerican chapter, LABMAN.
